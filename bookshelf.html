    <p>I enjoy browsing through peoples’ bookshelves (I found <a href="https://vivekraja.com/bookshelf">Vivek Raja’s</a> particularly insightful) to get recommendations of what to read. This is meant to be my version of that. Ones that I thought were quite insightful are highlighted in green.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18050143-zero-to-one">Zero to One</a></em>: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future - Peter Thiel</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business</li>
